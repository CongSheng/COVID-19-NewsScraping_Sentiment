# COVID-19-NewsScraping_Sentiment
Interested to learn about sentiment analysis and what better way to learn by doing it. I decided to just create a small and simple data scraping and sentiment analysis project centered around COVID-19 articles. 

## Project:
Using online news articles related to COVID-19, sentiment scores are obtained from the articles (Local news provider-TheStraitsTimes).

## Goal:
Potentially reflect the outlook of COVID-19.

## Future work (potentially):
* Visualization of sentiment score.
* Filter or group articles further and evaluate based on grouping/filter.
* Integrating with other COVID-19 data for better insights.
* Scraping using social media

## Inspiration and References
* Inspired by the ability of sentiment analysis through the Coursera and google cloud courses, I wished to learn more about it. From my observation, sentiment analysis is most effective when it comes to text mining, and the online news and social media are full of it. After learning about both topics from the post in https://towardsdatascience.com/https-towardsdatascience-com-algorithmic-trading-using-sentiment-analysis-on-news-articles-83db77966704, I am inspired to do it myself.
